  The 'difficulty' in patch aggregation is that you need to do some moving
  average calculations as patches could overlap. In this case we keep track

  patches the second the cummulation of the patch masks. The second one can
  be used as weight to find the average between to overlapping patches as
  some patches may have more overlap than others.

    To elaborate on this one, lets consider two examples of 5x5x5 patches
    with target volume 100x100x100:

    1. We have 10 patches batched together into [10, 5, 5, 5] then our indices
    need to be [10, 5, 5, 5, 3].
    2. We have a single patch of shape [5, 5, 5] and indices [5, 5, 5, 3].

    As a third example consider a flattened patch:

    3. We have 4 5x5x5 patches flattened into [500] then we need indices of
    shape [500, 3].

    In other words for the innermost dimension we need to provide an index
    into the target shape for every value but the outer dimensions are
    arbitrary as long as they are the same for indices and values.
